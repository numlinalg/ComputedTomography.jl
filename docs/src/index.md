# ComputedTomography

[ComputedTomography](https://github.com/numlinalg/ComputedTomography.jl) is a 
package for 
- simulating the results of a CT scan at one or multiple wavelengths
    of X-ray light, and for generating the system matrix for different 
    scan geometries.
- generating system matrices for different scan geometries and beam models.

There are two components to the documentation:
- The manual (coming soon) describes how to use the package and provides 
    examples. 
- The API describes the different data structures and methods in the package.
